## Installation

1. Clone this repo utilizing the green `<> Code` button to the folder of your choice. Optionally, download the source.

2. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your workstation. For instructions on installing Node.js for your operating system, please refer to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

3. Open a terminal (Linux/MacOS) or bash (Win) window and navigate to the source folder.

4. Run 'npm i' to initialize and download dependencies.

5. Run 'npm run dev' to initialize the site locally. Deployment of the web app is outside the scope of these instructions (follow your platform of choice's documentation).

## Usage

[Live version of the website](https://bright-toffee-48e73e.netlify.app/)

It's a pretty straightforward website showcasing my current level of experience with front-end technologies. I expect you will be able to browse it to your hearts content.

A couple of notes:
- The submit form does not currently work.
- The download resume button does not currently work.

These items will be enabled at a later point in time (when the backend is deployed).
